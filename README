===== Problem examples =====

Installing and loading the package, and then using the overloaded + operator
doesn't seem to work right. It calls the normal arithemtic + operator, and
gives a warning about incompatible methods.


library(badadd)
x <- structure(1, class = "a")
y <- structure(2, class = "b")
x + y
# [1] 3
# attr(,"class")
# [1] "a"
# Warning message:
# Incompatible methods ("+.a", "+.b") for "+"

# The two methods are identical
identical(badadd:::`+.a`, badadd:::`+.b`)
# [1] TRUE



But if you just copy and paste the methods in to an R session, it works.


`+.a` <- function (x1, x2) {
    message("Running custom + function")
}
`+.b` <- `+.a`

x + y
# Running + function
# NULL
